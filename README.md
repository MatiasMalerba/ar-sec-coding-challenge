# ZX Ventures / Siempre en Casa Challenge

## Welcome to Siempre En Casa!

>-- said no one, ever

This is why we are building [Siempre en Casa](https://siempreencasa.com.ar) - to free you from the hassle of going every week to the supermarket, to buy all the beverages you need. You set up your preferences once, and we will take your favorite drinks to your doorstep, at the best price ever.

Cool, right?

We strongly believe everyone deserves to have their drinking routines made easy no matter where, how and when they want it. To fulfill that, we use technology.
